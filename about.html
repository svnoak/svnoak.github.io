            <h2>What is a pracitcal privacy guide?</h2>
            <p>The practical privacy guide is like the name says: a guide that is focusing on the practical parts on privacy.
                With this guide I want to empower internet users to protect their own privacy online,
                and to create a pedagogical guide to make it as easy as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h2>Who made this guide?</h2>
            <p>This guide was made by Kim, someone who simply knows enough to make a practical guide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h2>Why should I trust this guide?</h2>
            <p>Like our parents said when we millenials started using the internet: 
                <br>
                “Don’t trust anything you read on the internet.”
                <br>
                I am simply someone who is working with webdevelopment and pedagogics and have an idea about that society can only walk towards a sustainable future if we are allowed to remain free in mind and soul. This is only possible de-commercialisation of us as people - both in real life and online.<br>
                I do not claim to know everything or be the guiding light regarding online privacy.
                <br>
                I have simply been a person who people have come to for advice regarding tech.
                This is only my way of sharing my knowledge.</p>
